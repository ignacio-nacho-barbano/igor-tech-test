# This is Nacho's Tech Interview Tests

. To test the exercises you must first run `npm i`

## The First Exercise Proposed Was a Custom Reverse Implementation

1.  Write a JavaScript or TypeScript function that takes a byte array as a parameter.
    The array contains ASCII codes for English language text. The function must
    reverse the order of words _in place_ without calling any library functions.

To see this run the command `npm run reverse`

## The Second Was a Unique Word Finder, equivalent to a custom Set

2. Write a function in JavaScript or TypeScript that takes a string of text as a parameter that returns the count of unique words.

To see this run the command `npm run unique`

## Tests

You can also test these files to make sure they are working properly
in a few differrent scenarios once changes are made.

To test the functions run the command `npm test`
